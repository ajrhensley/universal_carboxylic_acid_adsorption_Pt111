## Article Abstract
Carboxylic acids derived from biomass can be upgraded via heterogeneous catalytic processes to replacement petrochemicals or green hydrogen. However, despite extensive research, particularly on transition metal catalysts, the combined effects of intermolecular interactions and acid molecular structure on the dominant adsorbed acid configurations at catalytically relevant coverages remains underexplored. Here, such knowledge gaps are addressed by determining the coverage- and configuration-dependent adsorption behavior of seven carboxylic acids on Pt(111) using density functional theory and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. The carboxylic acids—ranging from formic acid to lactic acid—were chosen to vary carbon chain length and terminal end substituents. The results show that at moderate to high coverages (i.e. ≥0.111 ML), carboxylic acids preferentially form stable dimers on Pt(111), regardless of the individual acid’s molecular structure. This is due to strongly attractive intermolecular interactions through hydrogen bonding between neighboring R-COOH substituents. Dimer stability was further influenced by carbon chain length and the number and chain placement of R-OH substituents. Finally, the observed trends in adsorption energy with acid molecular structure were used to develop and validate a general additivity model for predicting the adsorption energies of carboxylic acid dimers on Pt(111) based solely on their molecular structure. This additivity model sheds light on the relative contributions of various substituents to adsorption strength: -COOH > -OH > -CH<sub>3</sub>. Overall, this work not only elucidates the important role of intermolecular interactions in the coverage- and configuration-dependent adsorption of carboxylic acids on transition metal surfaces but also provides a predictive tool for easily and rapidly calculating such adsorption energies.
